# It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia Website
This is solely a front-end project, built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It was built as one of three projects for my Code Institute bootcamp course.

It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia is a comedy tv series that has been running since 2005.
It centres around the owners of the fictional Paddy's Pub in Philadelphia. Charlie, Dennis, Mac, Dee and Frank who are
collectively known as 'the gang' spend their days making elaborate plans and conspiring against one another.
This website has a page dedicated to each member of 'the gang' who give a brief insight into their minds.
 
Each page is designed from my opinion of the charcters view and intends to show them in their
best light.

## Demo
The deployed version of the web app is available on github pages: https://colmhughes.github.io/Stream-One-Project/

## View locally
The repository is available on github: https://github.com/ColmHughes/Stream-One-Project
The git repository can be cloned and then simply run the index.html file.

## Built with 
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap
4. JavaScript
5. JQuery


## Media
Images were sourced from google images, the youtube videos were embedded using the iframe
html tag and audio was downloaded from zapsplat.com. The text contained on this site is
a blend of paraphrasing and direct quotes from the show.


## Wireframes
The wireframes for this project can be viewed on github in the 'Wireframes' folder. The project is
fully mobile-responsive with the only major difference being the home page and navbar which have separate sketches
for mobile and desktop. All sketches were made on 'wireframepro'.

## Testing
The project was tested on many different devices and across a range of browsers.
No automated testing was used, however all javascript/jquery was manually tested.
For example the quiz:
Inside the form I included type="number" into the input tag to limit the user to submitting numbers, I also
included the keyword 'required'.

Each answer was parsed into an integer and added together to get our total. Our total determines which image is shown.
Each answer was also passed into a function to ensure the number is between one and five inclusive, numbers outside this
range result in a modal advising the user to input a correct number.

The booking form, blackboard writing and carousel were also tested through a process of trial and error until the
desired effect was achieved.


## Left To Do
I intend on reworking this project so it uses angularjs, in order to gain a better understanding of the technology and
as a comparative test to see the pros and cons of each.
